# transportation and arrival

Send a rocket containing a folded initial zeppelin, now refered to as 
the `Mothership`, to venus, unpack the zeppelin when entering the venusian atmosphere and enter a stable orbit at an altitude of 50 km.

Both the transportation and the initial 'unpacking' of zeppelins was already considered in [HAVOC] and will therefore be ignored.

# stable orbit + initial setup

Once in stable orbit, the `Mothership` will use `3D printing` to create simpler zeppelins which are able to produce copies of themselves.

- [ ] printing the required components
    - [x] electrical circuits: is possible (google)
    - [ ] solar panels
        - [ ] with coating
- [ ] obtaining the required resources
- [ ] building a zeppelin inside of a zeppelin
- [x] how should the zeppelins be filled to allow flight.
    - [x] probably with pure N2, about `0.8 kg per mÂ³`.

# exponential growth

As the simpler zeppelins can self replicate, we now enter a phase of exponential growth, which leads to a large swarm of zeppelins which reproduce without relying on humans.

To enable flight zeppelins have to be filled with a gas which is less dense than the surrounding air. These zeppelins would fly at a operating altitude of 50 km.
